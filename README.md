# LevelEditor

A level editor designed to be integrated with Unity, such that you can export files from the level editor to Unity. The premise is similar to the Rain World level editor - easy controls but with an extremely high quality graphical output.

### Feature list (so far)
- Geometry editing, with tiles being able to slant at 45 degrees.
- Saving the level and loading it again to a simple file format.
- Exporting the geometry as a collection of continous edges.

### Installation Instructions

So long as you have [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) installed and integrated with Visual Studio, you should be able to easily clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio. vcpkg should handle installing any packages you need for you.
